Animals play an important role in our world. They come in many shapes and sizes, and each type of animal has its way of living. Some animals live in the wild, while others live with humans as pets. For example, dogs and cats are popular pets in many homes around the world. People take care of their pets by feeding them, giving them water, and making sure they have a safe place to live. In the wild, animals must find their food and shelter. Some animals, like lions and tigers, are predators that hunt other animals for food. Others, like cows and goats, are herbivores and eat plants. Each animal plays a role in its environment. For example, bees help plants grow by pollinating flowers. Fish provide food for larger animals in the ocean. There are also endangered animals that need our protection. Many species are at risk of disappearing because of pollution, climate change, and the destruction of their natural habitats. It is important to take care of animals and their homes to make sure they continue to thrive.
