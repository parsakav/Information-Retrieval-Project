In the morning, I usually wake up early and make myself a cup of coffee. After that, I like to read the news and check my emails. It helps me get ready for the day ahead. Then, I go for a quick walk around the neighborhood to enjoy the fresh air and clear my mind. Sometimes I meet friends or neighbors during my walk, and we chat about different topics. By the time I get back home, I feel energized and ready to start my work.
